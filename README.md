# simplestate

**Simplestate** helps developers create and manage finite state machines in the simplest way possibleâ€”focusing solely on states and transitions, leaving out complex event systems.

## Features

- Focus on states and transitions.
- Minimalistic and easy to use.
- Supports entering-state handlers for additional functionality.

## Installation

To install simplestate, use poetry:

```bash
poetry add simplestate
```

## Usage Example

Here's a basic example of using **simplestate**:

```python
from simplestate import StateMachine

m = StateMachine("loading")          # Define the machine with an initial state
m["loading"] + "error" >> "failed"   # Transition from loading to failed on "error"
m["loading"] + "ok" >> "success"     # Transition from loading to success on "ok"
m["?"] + "back" >> "loading"         # Any state transitions to loading on "back"

m.add_callbacks({                    # Add handlers for entering states
    "loading": lambda previous: print(f"{previous} >> loading"),
    "failed": lambda previous, error: print(f"{previous} >> failed: {error}"),
    "success": lambda previous: print(f"{previous} >> success"),
})

m.start()  # Start the machine, adjust inital state by this m.start(at_state="ok")
assert m.current == "loading"

m.handle("error", error="Something went wrong")  # Trigger transitions
assert m.current == "failed"

m.handle("back")
assert m.current == "loading"
```

## Why Simplestate?

The goal of **simplestate** is to keep finite state machines simple and focused. By eliminating complex event systems, you can easily manage states and transitions while keeping the code testable and maintainable.

### Event Handling on State Entry

Simplestate allows event handling when entering a state using `.add_callbacks()`. These callbacks take `previous` and an optional `**input_context`.

## FAQ

**Q: How can I handle state exit events?**  
A: You can use the entering handler for the next state to handle actions when leaving the previous state.

```python
def on_state_x(previous, **input_context):
    if previous == "a":
        do_this()
    elif previous == "b":
        do_that()
```

**Q: Can I represent the state machine as a class?**  
A: Yes! Think of simplestate as a state manager. You can compose it within your own class for handling side effects:

```python
class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        brain = StateMachine("red")
        brain["red"] + "next" >> "yellow_green"
        brain["yellow_green"] + "next" >> "green"
        brain["green"] + "next" >> "yellow_red"
        brain["yellow_red"] + "next" >> "red"
        brain.start("red")

        self.machine = brain

    def display(self) -> str:
        return self.machine.current

    def next(self) -> None:
        self.machine.handle("next")
```

## Tests

To run the tests:

```bash
poetry install --with test
poetry run pytest
```
